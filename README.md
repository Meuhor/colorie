# The Abandoned Meuhor's Blog source files

A personal blog powered by Colorie - Jekyll theme.

 Theme were forked from [Colorie](https://github.com/ronv/colorie). Removed jekyll-seo-tag plugin from origin gemfile, for Github page do not support this plugin yet, which cause the tag link in posts corrupted. Instead, switch to plugin-free jekyll technics to manage tags from [longqian's blog](http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/). Removed feed button from origin source currently.

A Chinese verison of these blogs are available on cnblogs page named [Just-Works](https://www.cnblogs.com/Just-Works/).
